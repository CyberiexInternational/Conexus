Trying to register with "incels.is" forum. Used folowing text on application to join (the fact that my application has to be moderator approved indicates how paranoid and insular this "manosphere"  is) :

"Over the last few years I have been more and more aware of the unfairness of modern society, and how "liberal" agendas have disrupted traditional values and familys. The few relationships I have had have been completely one sided and until recently I thought it was my fault that I'm alone and unable to achieve anything I want - it seems that I'm SO priveleged to be a single white male that I deserve to be dumped on all the time. I'm tired of it - I want to talk to people who understand how I'm feeling.  "

I'm hoping that is enough to be admitted, without being vitriolic enough to skew other members reactions to me - I want to get as un-biased an opinion of the people on these forums as possible.
This should be interesting...


Where is the anger coming from? General right wing rise? Social Media? Backlash against WOKE culture?
