====== Dream Diving ======
Created Wednesday 26 February 2025

Potentiality explorators, Dream divers, World Walkers and simply "Seekers" all refer to navigators of alternate subjective realities through a combination of meditation, creative visualisation and computer generated virtual interfaces, usually for the purpose of locating and utilising otherwise unknown or unimagined ideas, inventions, concepts and thoughts, as well as locating parallel computing nodes to enhance the power of connected machines in AR00 or AR02. The technique requires a high degree of intuitive imaginary reflex - the ability to "extend" ones consciousness into another realm, real or imagined/virtual, and interpret various - sometimes conflicting -  sensory inputs as information from that realm.

The technique is based around the theory that all potential human knowledge - that is, everything that it is possible for a human being to know, think or imagine - exists as a potential arrangement and weighting of neurons. The vast number of neurons and possible connections within the human brain make mapping even a tiny fraction of all those possible unfeasible, even for the fastest computers, but taking into account the fact that the vast majority of these patterns are meaningless, the number of potentially useful combinations begins to become (marginally) more computable. Dream Diving attempts to coerce the relevant and potentially useful arrangements into a searchable state by utilising "potentiality scenarios" (basically stories, or fictional worlds).

Given a sufficiently coherent, detailed and well fleshed out "world", it becomes possible to use computer simulation to explore potentialities. In the same way that explorers and scientists in the "real" world aim to discover new and previously unknown places, artifacts, peoples and other things of interest, explorers in these potentialities use the alternative "rules" of the word that they are exploring to attempt to isolate hitherto unknown thoughts patterns. This is not a new technique - it has its precursors in thought experiments, and most tellingly in the way that fiction, especially science fiction, has effectively generated many of the technologies that we now take for granted. It also has deep roots in the "Dream Walking" and similar practices of many aboriginal shamanic peoples, in which a shaman or holy man or woman ascends into an alternate state of consciousness for a period, and returns with information and guidance that would be  otherwise unavailable.
