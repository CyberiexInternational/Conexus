====== Conexus-2 ======
Created Sunday 23 February 2025

Exisitng as the supra-reality above/beyond Conexus-1, characterised by the recognition of lower levels of reality (sub-realities) as potentially fictional constructs (the word "fictional" here is intended to imply "created", rather than inferring a lack of veracity). 

While this could be viewed as a purely subjective way to validate various subrealities (i.e lend them a value beyond that of a purely traditionally fictional), it has a value if the subject referencing such constructs requires that validation for further referential purposes.

Of course, this entry is entirely within the remit of Conexus-2 (or 3,4.....etc) as a validation of a sub-reality, and so could be considered a completely self-referential construct without any true meaning or value at all. Which it probably is. The extensive and largely unneccesary use of overblown phrases and pretentious statements suggests a lack of confidence in the authors ability to express a concept, or even any kind of grasp of the concept itself.
