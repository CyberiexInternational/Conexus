====== Higher Order realities ======
Created Sunday 23 February 2025

Higher Order Realities (HRO's) consist of realities that contain and support other realities as a function of their fundamental structure (and are possibly contained and supported by other, higher order realities). In terms of simulation theory, this is one of the bases of arguments for the theories probable truth. As a sufficiently complex simulated reality would be capable of supporting any number of marginally less complex realities, and so on down the scale..the assumption that we (in AR00) occupy the "top" level of complexity is both unprovable and unlikely. The concept is often utilised in AR00 fiction, in such works as "1001 Arabian Nights", where the individual stories told by Sheharezade to her husband in an attempt to delay her execution often have characters which, in turn, narrate another story (which can then contain further individual narratives itself). Obviously, the entire "macro" tale of 'Arabian Nights is itself a story, and the recursive "russian doll" theme of stories within stories is repeated many times, and at many levels, throughout the tales. While 'Arabian Nights is far from the only or earliest of such works, it is a very fine example of the concept, and the fractal nature of the storytelling may in part stem from a fascination with the concept of fractal geometry in Arabain and Persian art, perhaps best expressed in the beautiful (and mind-bogglingly complex) practice of fractal calligraphy, wherein individual letters are made up of text themselves, the individual letters of which may themselves be constructed from text.... 
For this reason, Higher Order realites are sometimes referred to as "Fractal" realities, although this term can be misleading (although fractals form the basis of much of the reality most people accept as "Real", and can form a part of any number of lower level realities, the relationship is not necessarily essential to a Higher Order reality), and , in fact, since levels of reality are generally viewed as heirarchichal in detail or resolution, whereas true fractals display infinitely regressed similar detail across scales, the association is not truly accurate.
