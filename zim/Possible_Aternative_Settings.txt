AR00 : Our reality. Gloaming interstices rare but existing - not scientifically accepted, but researched and analysed by a few "fringe" scientists and conspiracy theorists.

AR01 : Either dead, as in no life at all, but totally existing infrasctructure and established structures - kind of Marie Celeste scenario. Otherwise, no human life but every other kind....  either way, more gloaming activity than AR00 (and maybe AAR02 ??) but otherwise not much different to AR00.

AR02 - Version 1 : Depending on the scenario, more advanced technologically due to both Gloaming influence and Babbage's perfection of the Analytical Engine. A kind of neo-gothic steam/cyberpunk - victorian inflected everything from architecture to social structure...kind of Arabesque-ish...empire-based, so British, German, French, Spanish and Russian empires, all advanced technologically, all retarded socially. One or two massive wars in the first half of the 20th century between the Prussian - Italian / Nazi German forces and the British / French  / Russian coalition. USA is basically a collection of relatively backward states, all vying for power...no real union, all heading towards a very right-wing republic (so, basically, AR00). (American civil war won by the southern states??)

AR02 - Version 2: Similar to V1, but WW1 and WW2 occurred as in AR00
