====== Special Executive ======
Created Sunday 03 November 2024

The Special Executive is the feared elite agency tasked with the protection of the British Empire from both external and internal threats. They are answerable to The Queen only, and have almost unlimited power within the Empire, including the right to enlist any of Her Majesties subjects, including all branches of the armed forces, police, regional governers etc, as well as private individuals and enterprises. The SE have a very shadowy  reputation for almost supernatural abilities (a reputation which they encourage) and are feared both within and without the empire. SE agents generally work alone or with a tight-knit hand selected team of variously skilled individuals to investigate potential threats, calling in support from other agencies only when the threat is too great to be eliminated quietly by themselves. 

The SE are renowned for employing extrmeley unorthodox covert means to achieve their goals, for example,  Weaponising Psychological DIsorders, individual "conversion", and, it is rumoured, emplying "[[Daemon Engines]]"  and other bizarre, proscribed technologies.

ALthough SE operatives can and do requisition any of the empires citizens and organisations, they often employ the services of the SUAS, as their covert nature and urban training make them the ideal choice for many operations, especially those where discretion and deniability are important. It is not uncommon for members of the SUAS to join the Pecial Excutive upon retirement or discharge due to ill health or injury.
