====== Sketchers ======
Created Wednesday 21 May 2025

The AR02 equivalent of hackers are "sketchers". Individual nodes on the global information network are represented to the sketcher by abstract shapes and patterns - in order to give these meaning, sketchers learn to hypontise themselves into a hyper-aware state called "Flow", which allows them to navigate the network, and carry out attacks, far, far faster than a human using a standard keyboard. The development of this Iconic interface was influenced greatly by Conexus theory - in fact, the network itself is a microcosm of the entire Conexus, and the Gheling Transforations used in Conexus theory are used (in much simplified form) by hackers to manipulate the iSpace (information space - as oposed to rSpace) to achieve their goals. 

The actual techniques used vary from individual to individual, and more widely from one school of technique to another, but all have their basis in Taoist meditation techniques, with aspects of Bhuddhism and Hinduism.
