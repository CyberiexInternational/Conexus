====== Cyberia ======
Created Saturday 07 June 2025

Virtual, hyper-territorial nation-state created in AR00 in 2025. Cyberia is governed by one defining recursive "Law" :

1) ALL people shall be free to do whatever they choose, provided that they fully enforce this law.

While apparently simple, The Law is very demanding on its true devotees - whatever act that one may be considerign must be examined to ensure that committing the act will not ownly not harm another, but that it will not interfere with anothers ability to enforce the law themselves. In practice, this makes any action difficult - if I eat one of the two conuts left in the box, I am preventing my colleague from being able to eat both donuts if she wishes. Although should she do so, or eat one of them herself, she will also be breaking the law.

In a practical sense, the Law is usually expressed as "Do what thou will, but harm none", a common refrain of pagans, lbertarians, humanists etc throughout history.
