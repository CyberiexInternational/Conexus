====== Daemon Engines ======
Created Monday 23 September 2024

For many years before the development of practical analytical engines (especially for battefield use) in the west, Generals and upper-echelon politicians and warmakers in the eastern world (mainly China, Japan, and to some extent, India) developed so-called Daemon engines, using beings from another Gloaming accessible reality to provide the computational power to perform battlefield calculations, process vast amounts of data etc - essentially the same tasks that Babbage engines are employed to facilitate. Although these engines can in many ways outperform Babbage engines, they are subject to the whims and vagueries of the entity that "powers" them. This makes them unpredictable and potentially incredibly dangerous - there are several cases of military actions being ordered on the basis of information generated by a daemon engine that have resulted in massive bloodshed and chaos, for both sides of the engagement.
