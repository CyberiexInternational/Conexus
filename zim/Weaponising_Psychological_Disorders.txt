====== Weaponising Psychological Disorders ======
Created Tuesday 04 June 2024

The manipulation of individuals with psychological abnormalities (such as sociopathy) to effectively turn them into living weapons has been practiced since the mid 19th century in AR02, but with advances in technology and psychological theory, it has become both more widespread and effective, despite being banned under international law. 
In the most extreme cases, individuals with known psychopathic tendencies are nurtured and encouraged in their illness, in addition to being given the support and protection required to enact their desires and fantasies. This occurs either covertly in the target area in which the "weapon" is to be utilised (typically an area of high urban density), or in more controlled laboratory conditions (usually within the territory of the country or organisation developing the weapon) with the intention of releasing the sociopath on an enemy population when a sufficient level of potential for terror has been developed. 
Weaponisation of sociopathy differs from more traditional terrorism in that the enacting agency generally doesn't claim resposibility for the atrocities committed as a result or their actions - the desired goal is to promote terror, instability and mistrust in the population with the intention of rendering it more suscpetible to other, usually more subtle, forms of manipulation. This lack or accoiuntability makes the tactic patricularly attractive to those attempting the political, rather than military, conquest of a small population, or (in the case of industrial terrorism) the destabilisation of a competing organisations key workforce and its families.
